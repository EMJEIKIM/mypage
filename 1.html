    <p>I'm on my way to the bank right now. I'll be back in about half an hour.<br>While you're out, Could you pick up an extension cord for me?<br>Sure, I guess I can swing by a supermarket on my way back.<br>And, oh, I actually have a few more things I need <strong>If you don't <u>mind</u>.</strong><br>Hey, if you have some things to buy, you might as well just come with me.</p>
